> Yo! Welcome to the slickest metro navigation system this side of the planet. We're bringing that NYC subway energy to Noida, baby! 🚇✨

## 🌆 Why This Hits Different

Listen up! Here's why this ain't your regular metro app:

- **Path Finding That SLAPS** 🔥
  - Multiple routes? We gotchu
  - Minimum stops? Say less
  - Shortest path? You already know
  - Custom routes? We flex like that

- **User System Straight Outta Silicon Valley** 💯
  - Secure login that's tight like Times Square on New Year's
  - Metro card system smoother than a Brooklyn barista's latte
  - Data persistence like your mama's memory of that one time you messed up

- **Real Numbers, No Cap** ⚡
  - Distance? We measure that
  - Fares? We calculate that
  - Time estimates? We predict that
  - Balance? We track that

## 🎮 How We Roll

### The Secret Sauce (Tech Stack)
```txt
INGREDIENTS:
- Graph Theory (the fancy stuff)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm (because we're bougie like that)
- DFS (deeper than a late-night convo in Washington Square Park)
- Data Structures (stacked like our subway platforms)
```

### Running This Bad Boy

```bash
# Fire it up like a Times Square billboard
./metro_system

# Choose your vibe
1. Login (Welcome back, fam!)
2. Sign Up (Ay, new friend!)

# Plot your journey like a real New Yorker
Enter source: SEC-51
Enter destination: PARI-CHOWK
```

## 🎯 The Station Lineup

We got stations like NYC got pizza joints - everywhere you need 'em:
- SEC-51 (our Grand Central, if you will)
- NSEZ (think Wall Street, but make it Noida)
- Knowledge Park (like Columbia University, but with more swagger)
- Pari Chowk (Times Square energy, desi style)

## 🚀 What's Next? (Future Drops)

Ay, we're cooking up some heat:
- [ ] Real-time updates (like your ex's Instagram, but useful)
- [ ] Mobile app that's smoother than a downtown jazz bar
- [ ] Payment system quicker than a New York minute
- [ ] Crowd updates (avoid that rush hour drama)

## 🤝 Roll With Us

Got ideas? We're all ears! Fork this repo like it's your favorite food truck and hit us with them pull requests.

What we're looking for:
- Code that slaps harder than a NYC pizza slice

- Documentation clearer than a Manhattan skyline

## 📝 The Fine Print

MIT License (lawyer speak for "sharing is caring")

## 💫 Big Ups To

- The OG subway systems worldwide
- Every coder who's ever debugged at 3 AM
- The professors who said "yeah, this could work"
- Stack Overflow (you the real MVP)

Built with that NYC hustle + Noida heart ❤️

*If this metro system was a pizza, it'd be a dollar slice - cheap, reliable, and gets the job done right!* 🍕

```cpp
if (you.isLiking(this_project)) {
    you.should.definitely.star();
    // Real ones know what's up
}
```
